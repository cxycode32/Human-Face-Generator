# PROGAN (Progressive Growing of GANs)

ProGAN is a type of GAN designed to generate high-resolution images in a progressive manner. The key innovations in this model are:

- **Progressive Growing:** The model starts with small images (e.g., 4x4) and progressively grows to larger ones (e.g., 1024x1024).
- **Minibatch Standard Deviation:** A technique to improve diversity in generated images by giving the discriminator information about variation across batches.
- **Pixel Normalization (PixelNorm):** Normalizing pixel values in feature maps to stabilize training.
- **Equalized Learning Rate (WSConv2d):** A technique to improve training stability by scaling weights dynamically.

## How to Train?
```bash
python train.py
```


## Visualization:

### Fake Images
Helper function to save fake images generated by the generator.
```
def save_fake_images(generator, fixed_noise, epoch, dir=IMAGE_DIR):
```

### Fake Images GIF
Helper function to create a GIF from fake images.
```
def create_gif(assets_dir=ASSETS_DIR, image_dir=IMAGE_DIR, filename="gan_training.gif"):
```

### Discriminator and Generator Loss Visualization
Helper function to visualize discriminator losses and generator losses.
```
def plot_losses(disc_losses, gen_losses, dir=ASSETS_DIR, filename="gan_loss.png"):
```

### Tensorboard
Run the following command:
```
tensorboard --logdir logs
```
After you've finished running the script. Remember to `cd` to the directory where your `logs` folder is.
